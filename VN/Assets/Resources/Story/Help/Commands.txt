                                                                           Raelin "Oh? Why is that?"

  #Make Choices (DONE)
  Begin a line with the keyword 'choice' to initiate a player choice.               ex:
	  choice "choice title"                                                         choice "Do you like to write visual novels?"
	  {                                                                             {
		"Choice A"                                                                    "Yes, I love to."
		  Line to execute when choice is made                                           Load(story_chapterA)
		"Choice B"                                                                    "No, I don't do that."
		  Line to execute if this choice is made INSTEAD                                Load(story_chapterB)
		"etc"                                                                         "I'm not answering that."
		  etc.                                                                          Avira "Oh. Okay then."
	  }                                                                             }
  #USING EVENTS INSIDE OF dialogue
  events are contained inside of brackets []. They control things that happen while dialogue is being displayed.
  Actions can be called withing brackets as they would normally be called at the end of a line. Separate actions by a space character.
                                                                                ex: "Hello [showScene(true,blur)]everyone!"
  then there are events that control different things aside from regular actions.
  [txtSpd speed,charactersPerFrame] - change text architect speed               ex: "Let's move [txtSpd 15,2]slowly."
  [/txtSpd] - return architet to normal speed.                                  ex: "Move [txtSpd 30,1]slow [/txtSpd]but then return to normal speed."
